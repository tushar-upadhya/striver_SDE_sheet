# Approach: 
* The matrix is treated as a flattened array by mapping the indices of the 2D matrix to the indices of the 1D array.
* Check if the matrix is empty. If it is, return false as the target cannot be found.
* Obtain the number of rows (rows) and columns (cols) in the matrix.
* Set the left pointer (left) to 0 and the right pointer (right) to the last index of the flattened matrix (rows * cols - 1).
* Enter a while loop that continues until the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer.
* Calculate the middle index (mid) using the formula left + (right - left) / 2.
* Retrieve the value at the middle index in the matrix (midValue) by mapping the 1D index to the corresponding row and column indices (mid / cols and mid % cols, respectively).
* Compare midValue with the target:
  * If they are equal, return true as the target has been found.
  * If midValue is less than the target, update the left pointer to mid + 1 to search in the right half of the remaining range.
  * If midValue is greater than the target, update the right pointer to mid - 1 to search in the left half of the remaining range.
* If the loop completes without finding the target, return false.

# Time Complexity: O(log(m*n)), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. The binary search is performed on the flattened matrix, which has a total of m * n elements.
# Space Complexity: O(1). The code uses only a constant amount of additional space for the variables.
