# explanation

* The code defines a nested class Tuple that represents a tuple containing a TreeNode, row coordinate, and column coordinate. This is used to store node information during the traversal.
* The verticalTraversal method takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns a list of lists representing the vertical order traversal of the tree.
* The code initializes a TreeMap map to store the vertical values (columns) of the nodes. Each vertical value maps to another TreeMap that stores the horizontal values (rows) as keys and PriorityQueue of node values in increasing order as values.â€‹
* A Queue q is created to perform the level-order traversal. The initial tuple containing the root node with coordinates (0, 0) is added to the queue.
* The code enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty.
* Inside the while loop, a tuple is dequeued from the queue. The tuple's values (node, x, y) are extracted.
* The code inserts the node value into the TreeMap map based on its coordinates. If the vertical coordinate x is not present in the map, a new entry is created. If the horizontal coordinate y is not present in the inner TreeMap corresponding to x, a new entry is created. Finally, the node value is added to the PriorityQueue in the inner TreeMap.
* The code checks if there are left and right child nodes of the current node. If present, new tuples are created with updated coordinates (x-1, y+1) for the left child and (x+1, y+1) for the right child, and they are added to the queue.
* After the while loop, the TreeMap map contains the nodes grouped by their vertical and horizontal coordinates.
* A List of Lists list is created to store the node values in each vertical. The TreeMap map is iterated over in the order of its keys (vertical coordinates).
* For each vertical coordinate, a new sublist is created in the list.
* The PriorityQueue of node values for each horizontal coordinate in the current vertical is iterated over. The node values are extracted from the PriorityQueue and added to the sublist in the list.
* Finally, the list is returned, representing the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
