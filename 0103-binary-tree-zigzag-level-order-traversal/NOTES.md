* â€‹The zigzagLevelOrder function takes a TreeNode object root as input and returns a list of lists representing the zigzag level order traversal of the tree.
* If the root is null, indicating an empty tree, the function returns an empty list result.
* Otherwise, the function initializes an empty list result to store the final result.
* The function also initializes a queue q using a LinkedList implementation and adds the root node to the queue using the offer method.
* It also initializes an integer j to keep track of the current level.
* While the queue q is not empty, the function performs the following steps:
  * Retrieves the current size of the queue using the size method to get the number of nodes in the current level.
  * Initializes a new ArrayList list to store the node values in the current level.
  * Iterates through the nodes in the current level using a for loop from 0 to size-1:
     * Retrieves the node from the front of the queue using the poll method.
     * Adds the value of the node to the list using the add method.
     * If the node has a left child, it is added to the queue using the offer method.
     * If the node has a right child, it is added to the queue using the offer method.
  *  If the current level j is odd (j % 2 == 1), the list is reversed using the Collections.reverse method.
  *  Adds a new ArrayList containing the elements of list to the result list using the add method.
  *  Increments the level j by 1.

* After the traversal is complete, the result list contains the zigzag level order traversal of the tree, with nodes in alternate levels reversed if needed.
* Finally, the result list is returned as the output.
