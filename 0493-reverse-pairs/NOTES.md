# Approach:

* The code utilizes the merge sort algorithm to count the number of reverse pairs in the given array.
* It recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains a single element.
* It merges the subarrays while counting the reverse pairs and updates the original array.


# Time Complexity  of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
#  space complexity of the code is O(n) due to the additional ArrayList used for merging the subarrays.
