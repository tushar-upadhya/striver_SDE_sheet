â€‹* The height method is a helper function that calculates the height of a given node in the tree. It takes a TreeNode as input and recursively computes the height by finding the maximum height between its left and right subtrees. The height of a leaf node is considered to be 0.
* In the diameterOfBinaryTree method, we start by checking if the root is null. If the root is null, it means we have an empty tree, so the diameter is 0, and we return it.
* Next, we calculate the heights of the left and right subtrees of the root using the height method. We store the left subtree's height in the variable leftHeight and the right subtree's height in the variable rightHeight.
* To compute the diameter passing through the root node, we add the heights of the left and right subtrees: rootDiameter = leftHeight + rightHeight.
* Now, we recursively compute the diameters of the left and right subtrees by calling the diameterOfBinaryTree method on the left and right child nodes of the root, respectively. We store the results in the variables leftDiameter and rightDiameter.
* Finally, we return the maximum among the three diameters: rootDiameter, leftDiameter, and rightDiameter. This represents the maximum diameter possible in the binary tree.

   By computing the maximum diameter at each level of recursion, we eventually obtain the overall diameter of the binary tree.
