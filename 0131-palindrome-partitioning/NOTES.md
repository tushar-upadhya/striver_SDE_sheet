# Approach
The approach used in the code is a backtracking approach. It recursively partitions the string s into substrings and checks if each substring is a palindrome. If it is, the substring is added to the current partition list, and the remaining part of the string is recursively partitioned. This process continues until the entire string is partitioned, and the current partition list is added to the final result.

# Explanation:

* The partition function initializes an empty result list and calls the helper function to start the backtracking process.
* The helper function takes three parameters: the remaining string s, the current partition list currList, and the final result list result.
* If the remaining string s is empty, it means the entire string has been partitioned, so the current partition list currList is added to the result list result.â€‹
* The function then iterates through different partition points i from 1 to the length of the string s.
* For each partition point, it separates the string into two parts: the left part from index 0 to i, and the right part from index i onwards.
* It checks if the left part is a palindrome using the ispalindrome function.
* If it is a palindrome, a copy of the current partition list currList is made, and the left part is added to the copy.
* The helper function is recursively called with the right part of the string and the updated copy of the partition list.
* This process continues for all possible partition points, exploring different partition combinations.
* Finally, the result list contains all possible palindrome partitionings of the given string s, which is returned.

  # time complexity is O(N * 2^N), where N is the length of the string s. This is because for each partition point, we have two choices: either include it in the current palindrome substring or start a new palindrome substring.
  # space complexity is O(N * 2^N), where N is the length of the string s. This is because the recursion depth can go up to N, and for each partition, a new substring is created, which can have a total length of N.
