â€‹* The minSubArrayLen method takes two parameters: target and nums. It returns an integer representing the minimum length of a subarray that meets the criteria.
* The method initializes variables i, j, sum, and min. i and j represent the left and right pointers of the sliding window, sum stores the current sum of elements in the window, and min keeps track of the minimum length found so far.
* The method uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum length subarray. It starts with i and j both pointing to the start of the array, and sum and min set to 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE, respectively.
* The code enters a loop that continues until the right pointer j reaches the end of the array.
* Inside the loop, the code increments sum by adding nums[j] to it, then increments j by 1. This expands the window to the right and includes the current element in the sum.
* After expanding the window, the code enters another loop that continues as long as the sum is greater than or equal to the target. This loop is responsible for shrinking the window from the left side.
* Inside the shrinking loop, the code checks if the current window length (j - i) is smaller than the current minimum min. If so, it updates min with the new minimum length.
* The code then subtracts nums[i] from sum and increments i by 1, effectively shrinking the window from the left side.
* The shrinking loop continues until the sum is no longer greater than or equal to the target. At this point, the window cannot be further shrunk, so the code exits the inner loop and continues expanding the window from the right side.
* After the outer loop finishes, the method returns the minimum length min. If min has not been updated during the execution, it means that no subarray exists whose sum is greater than or equal to the target, so the method returns 0.

#  time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums. The algorithm performs a single pass through the array using two pointers, i and j, and the shrinking loop inside the main loop operates at most n times. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input.
# space complexity is O(1)
